# Documentation Overview

The docs/ directory is organised around practical guides that explain the codebase through eleven core principles. Each markdown file in guides/ focuses on a specific angle so contributors can drill straight into the behaviour they need.

## Guide Index

| Guide-first approach | guides/01-quickstart.md |
| Show, don't tell | guides/02-session-tracker-walkthrough.md |
| More code than text | guides/03-cli-snippets.md |
| Use plausible data | guides/04-realistic-data.md |
| Examples as stories | guides/05-chat-story.md |
| Reference follows the guide | guides/06-reference-follows-guide.md |
| Pages can be scanned quickly | guides/07-scan-friendly-pages.md |
| Features have several names | guides/08-searchable-vocabulary.md |
| Document features multiple times | guides/09-multi-context-coverage.md |

When adding new documentation, start with the relevant guide to keep the narrative consistent. Cross-link guides, how-tos, references, and recipes so readers can jump between depth levels without losing context.
