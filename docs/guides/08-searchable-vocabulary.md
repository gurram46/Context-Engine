# Searchable Vocabulary

Different teams use different terminology, so the docs should mention common synonyms. Examples already in use:

- \"Palette\", \"command palette\", and \"command launcher\" all refer to the Ink selector implemented in ui/index.js.
- \"Tracker\", \"watchdog\", and \"session monitor\" describe the worker in ackend/context_engine/core/session_tracker.py.

When contributing docs, add these alternate names to section headings or introductory sentences so search (both in GitHub and within the docs site) leads readers to the right page.
