# Scan-Friendly Pages

Make every page easy to skim:

- Use descriptive headings (## Start Tracking, ### Stop Tracking).
- Prefer bullet or numbered lists for command sequences.
- Surface critical callouts with blockquotes:

> Tip: context session status works even when the tracker is idle—it simply reports "Session tracking is not running."

- Keep paragraphs short (one idea each) so readers can jump directly to what they need.

Following this layout keeps long technical pages approachable, especially when paired with the quickstart and reference sections.
